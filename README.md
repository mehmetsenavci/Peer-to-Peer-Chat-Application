# Peer-to-Peer-Chat-Application

->Developed on MacOS.

->Creates the Users.txt and ChatLog.txt files under the /Users directory.

->Can't find the way to include the modules that are used in the project to executable files, therefore processes can be ran under the list directory manually.

->P2Pserver file sometimes can start printing infinitely many empty lines in the terminal and in the ChatLog.txt file if the P2Pclient is terminated before the server. To prevent any system crashes be careful. If server starts that action terminate the server as soon as possible.

-> Used libraries are son, time, date time and socket.
